# belly

> Git shortcuts for common tasks.


## Install

```
$ npm install --global belly
```

## Why?

There are a few things in Git that I do a lot. Some things I need in regular intervals but I always have to look up the commands. So I created this CLI tool to simplify the Git tasks I need the most.

## Why Not Use Git Aliases?

Sure, I could have used Git aliases but I wanted to have something a bit more portable and shareable.

## OK, So What Does It Do?

I thought you'd never ask!

### Stage Everything, Commit Everything & Push To Origin: `belly c`

I do this a lot. I commit early and often in my feature branches and
always push it to the server. That is what `belly c` does.

Type `belly c` and belly will stage everything, commit it with the
commit message `belly auto-commit` and push it to origin.

You can specify a commit message with `-m`.

Sometimes it's fine to just commit with a generic commit message.
Especially if it is minor work, you're the only person working on
the project or if you'll squash all commits in the end anyway.

### Switch To The Last Branch Or To An Existing Branch Or Create A New Branch: `belly s`

When we navigate between branches we typically either want to switch to an existing branch or
create a new one and switch to that one.

Why do we need multiple commands for that?

`belly s` does it all. If you don't specify a branch name it just switches to the last branch
you were on. If you specify a branch name of an existing branch like: `belly s branch-name`, it will switch to that. If the branch doesn't exist it will create it and switch to it.

### Tag the current commit with a version number and push tags to the server: `belly t`

In order to annotated-tag the current commit with a version number and push the tag to the server use `belly t <version-number>`.

### Rename your local and your remote branch in one go: `belly n <branch-name>`

`belly n <branch-name>` will rename your local branch with `-m <branch-name>`, then delete your remote branch with `push :<current-branch-name>` and push the new branch to the server with `push -u <new-branch-name>`.

### Rebase the current branch on to `origin/master` and if it doesn't fail, squash the branch: `belly q -m <commit-message>`

If your team wants to keep a clean Git history you will most likely have to rebase your branch on a regular basis and squash your commits into one commit per feature.

`belly q` is here to help! The command will `fetch origin`, then rebase your current branch on to `origin/master` just to make sure you rebased. Then it will do a `reset --soft` back to `origin/master` and then commit all your changes with either an auto-commit message or the commit message you specified with `-m`.

## Usage

```
$ [belly | b] --help

  Usage
    $ belly [c | s | t | n | q]

  Options
    --help                           Display this message
    --message -m "<commit message>"  Add a custom commit message

  Examples
    Commit all staged and unstaged changes with a generic
    commit message and push the commit to origin
    $ belly c

    Commit all staged and unstaged changes with a custom
    commit message and push the commit to origin
    $ belly c -m "Made some awesome changes"

    Switch to last branch or switch to/create a branch with a specific name
    $ belly s [some-branch]

    Tag and annotate the current commit with a version number
    and push the tag to origin
    $ belly t 1.4.2

    Rename the current branch locally and on origin
    $ belly n some-branch

    Squash all commits since master
    $ belly q -m "Made some awesome changes"
```

## Why "belly"?
When looking for a name I started with `git-shortcuts` which was to long
so I shortened it to `g-cuts`. Still too long. `guts` was cool but a little
gross so `guts` became `belly`.
